# Introduction

This is the app we developed in the LA1 group during the first practice session. It is here mainly for those of you that may
have had any trouble finishing it.

# Getting a copy

You can clone this project from the command line using git:

    git clone https://github.com/jvilar/TemperatureConverter.git
    
And then open it in Android Studio, but it is easier to check it out directly with Android Studio. Close
your current project and select "Check out project from Version Control", then Git.
Use `https://github.com/jvilar/TemperatureConverter.git` for the URL.
